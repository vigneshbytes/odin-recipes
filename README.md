this is typed from local PC using nano filenme

installed remote ssh plugin on vscode in windows and connected my pi host using `ssh pi@192.168.x.x` > saving the config to windows11 default location
ctrl+~ is the command to open terminal
things feel snappy and smooth from here

this is better than configuring powershell to use  `ssh -X pi@192.168.x.x` since the apps are getting sent to windows without an apt graphic-server
